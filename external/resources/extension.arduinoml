# ArduinoML does not support temporal transitions, i.e., transitions that are 
#   triggered a specific amount of time after entering in a state. 
#   This extension will allow it. Of course, such extension implies support for 
#   several output transitions from a single state.
# Acceptance scenario: Alan wants to define a state machine where LED1 is switched 
#   on after a push on button B1 and switched off 800ms after, waiting again 
#   for a new push on B1.
